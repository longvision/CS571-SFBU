# Technology: (Cloud Computing course) - SFBU - CS 571

## Javascript and Node.js:

1. The problem was to create a node.js server and to return a object with the requested format.
2. The ppt with the response and code is attached.

### Solution:

I added a new condition to check if the param in the route is of currenttime. If so, the current time is returned and formatted into a JSON object.

#### Design:

A new function of currenttime was also added to format to the requested format.

#### Modification:

The server is now listening to the port 8000, without needing to pass as CLI parameter.

#### Ownership:

The code developed was a improvement and modification of a given code.
It was not developed 100% by me.
